INTRODUCTION
Question: What are some key factors leading to hesitancy for the COVID vaccine?
Hypothesis: Demographics (Proximity to medical care), Political Affiliation, Education, Religion, Age, Gender, Race, Socioeconomic Status, Occupation
THE DATA (Everyone can edit up 4 pm - Group Meeting on 10/3/21 at 4 pm EST)
https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations/#united-states-vaccination-data
https://ourworldindata.org/us-states-vaccinations
Census Race Data
Precinct level Election Results
County Level Election Data
Interesting query system for medical data based on County
COVID-19 County Hesitancy
Starting dataset: COVID-19 County Hesitancy data (CDC)
Joined dataset #1: Census data
Joined dataset #2: Election data
Joined dataset #3: Healthcare data

All data joined on County (will likely have to use either Census tract or Fips Code)
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
Take data and join into one dataset based on location (either zip or census tracts)
Pre-processing and data clean-up
Correlation between variables
Regression analysis (Model for predicting outcome on new data)
Machine Learning techniques (Random Forest, Clustering)
Using ML techniques, identify variables of interest. Then create a model to predict outcomes on new data

TESTING
Data will be split into two groups (66% training, 34% test)
Models and variable selection will be done on training set
Model validation done on test set
Will use unit tests for python code
OUTCOME
Goal is to combine data to effectively analyze populations, groups, and areas that may be predisposed to a higher level of vaccine hesitancy.
This could be used by governments to focus education on the groups to elaborate on understanding of the vaccine, and alleviate any discomfort/hesitancy towards the vaccine
Summarize your plan and explain how your findings could be used by others (if applicable).
